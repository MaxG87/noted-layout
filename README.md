# Noted Layout
For an introduction to the <em>Noted</em> layout, see the <a href="https://dariogoetz.github.io/noted-layout/">introduction page</a>.

<em>Noted</em> is a keyboard layout that aims to allow efficient and comfortable typing both in German and English.

It has its roots in the <a href="https://www.neo-layout.org">Neo family</a> of German alternate keyboard layouts and aims to improve upon them.

The design of the <em>Noted</em> layout was supported by a newly developed <a href="https://github.com/dariogoetz/keyboard_layout_optimizer">optimizer</a> based on a mixed-language corpus (60% German, 40% English).
